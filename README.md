## General Information
•	Project Background:
The project focuses on predicting the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The goal is to help BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider, understand the factors influencing bike rentals and prepare for post-pandemic demand.
•	Business Problem:
BoomBikes has experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They aim to predict bike rental demand to optimize their business strategy and meet customer expectations once the economy recovers.
•	Dataset Used:
The dataset contains daily bike rental data, including features like season, weather, temperature, and user type (casual vs. registered). The target variable is cnt (total bike rentals).

## Conclusions
1.	Temperature (temp): Higher temperatures significantly increase bike rentals, as people prefer to ride bikes in pleasant weather.
2.	Year (yr): The demand for bikes has been increasing over the years, indicating a growing trend in bike-sharing systems.
3.	Weather Situation (weathersit): Clear weather conditions lead to higher demand, while poor weather (rain, snow) reduces rentals.
4.	Working Day (workingday): Bike rentals are higher on working days, especially among registered users, as bikes are used for commuting.
